Ochi Design Clone
🚀 Ochi Design Clone
A practice project where I created a clone of the Ochi Design website to enhance my skills in React.js, Tailwind CSS, and Framer Motion.

Framer Motion: For implementing smooth animations and transitions.

Smooth animations using Framer Motion.
Clean and modern UI design inspired by Ochi Design.
